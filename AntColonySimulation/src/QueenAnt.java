/**********************************************************************************************************
 * The queen ant is responsible for hatching new ants. The specific requirements for the queen ant are:
1. The queen never moves from her square (i.e., she remains in the same square for the entire simulation).
2. The queen's maximum lifespan is 20 years.
3. The queen hatches new ants at a constant rate of 1 ant/day (i.e., 1 ant every 10 turns).
4. New ants should always be hatched on the first turn of each day.
The type of ant that is hatched should be determined randomly according to the initial frequencies listed below. You may
change these frequencies as you see fit â€” these are simply suggestions for a starting point.
5.
a. Forager - 50%
b. Scout - 25%
c. Soldier - 25%
6. The queen should consume 1 unit of the food in her chamber on each turn, including the turn in which she hatches a new ant.
7. If the food level in the queen's square is zero when the queen tries to eat, the queen dies of starvation.
8. If the queen dies, either by starvation or by a Bala attack, the simulation should end immediately.
